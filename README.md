The project aims to visualise Christchurch's cycling data in recent years and parking data from seven car parks in Christchurch city centre in 2020, and to study the impact of weather (including temperature, humidity and wind speed) on people's commuting preferences, as well as the impact of weekdays or weekends.

Cycle Dashboard:
The Cycle Dashboard shows each of the sensor location on the map and the number of observations for that counter or nearby counters for the selected date range and few plots that shows the effect of Weather on the count of bicycles.

Parking Dashboard:
The Parking Dashboard shows the location of each car park on the map and the number of observations for that car park for the selected date range and few plots that shows the effect of Weather on the usage of car parks.

Cycle Prediction:
This tab gives us a prediction of the count of bicycle considering the given input, and gives us a plot to show the comparison with historic data.

Parking Prediction:
This tab gives us a prediction of the Percentage of Occupied Parking Slots considering the given input, and gives us a plot to show the comparison with historic data.
